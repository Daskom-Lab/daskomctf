Once upon a time in a quite and peaceful morning, a hacker got an access to a database for a big company, the company didnt know about it (yet), but here you are, the hero, the savior of all time, the one that could protect this company from a big disaster thats about to happen.

This company market model is about selling flags to the user, and there is exactly only one table that contains flag in one of the column name, but problem is there are thousands of tables in the database and i dont understand anything about sql, please help them find that table and safe them from the nasty hacker.

> The flag is the table name wrapped with dctf1337{}
> ex: dctf1337{tableA}
